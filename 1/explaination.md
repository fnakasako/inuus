## **2. Technical Decisions and Rationale**

### **2.1 Phonetic & Prosodic Analysis**

#### **Decision**: Utilize the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary and G2P Models

- **Tools Chosen**:
  - **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary**: For accurate phoneme-to-word mappings.
  - **G2P Models** (e.g., [Tacotron](https://github.com/keithito/tacotron)): To handle out-of-dictionary words and generate phoneme sequences.

#### **Rationale**:

- **Flexibility**: G2P models extend capabilities to handle novel or rare words not present in the dictionary, essential for analyzing diverse literary texts.
- **Prosody Analysis**: Stress patterns and rhyme potentials are crucial for understanding the rhythm and sound aesthetics in literature, aligning with the project's focus on fundamental linguistic mechanisms.

#### **Uncertainties**:

- **Coverage**: While the CMU Dictionary is extensive, it may not cover all linguistic nuances, especially in highly stylized or archaic texts.
- **G2P Accuracy**: G2P models may introduce errors in phoneme prediction for complex or non-standard word forms.

#### **Potential Improvements**:

- **Enhanced Phonetic Models**: Incorporate more advanced or language-specific G2P models to improve phoneme accuracy.
- **Dynamic Dictionary Expansion**: Continuously update the phonetic dictionary with new words extracted from the corpus to reduce reliance on G2P predictions.
