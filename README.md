# Literary AI System

## Core Philosophy
This project approaches literature from a fundamental linguistic perspective, viewing great works as sophisticated implementations of linguistic patterns and mechanisms. Rather than focusing on traditional literary devices or surface-level analysis, we examine how language shapes thought and experience through pattern matching and evolution.

### Key Theoretical Foundations
- Literature operates through fundamental linguistic mechanisms rather than traditional literary devices
- Great works succeed through sophisticated pattern matching and evolution
- Literary creation emerges from the manipulation of linguistic patterns at multiple scales
- Analysis must focus on how language shapes thought and experience

1. Low-level linguistic patterns
2. Mid-level conceptual patterns
3. High-level structural patterns
4. Meta-patterns governing pattern interactions
